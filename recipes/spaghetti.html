        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat (we use a Dutch oven). Add the meat and cook until browned, about 8 minutes. As the meat cooks, use a wooden spoon to break it up into smaller crumbles.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Add the onions and cook, stirring every once and a while, until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Take the sauce off of the heat, and then stir in the basil. Toss in the cooked pasta, and then leave for a minute so that the pasta absorbs some of the sauce. Toss again, and then serve with parmesan sprinkled on top.</li>
        </ol>
