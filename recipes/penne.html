    <h1>Sausage Penne</h1>
    <img src="../images/penne.jpg">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        Italian sausage and pasta is a magical combo. This pasta recipe is ideal for those sausage and carb lovers out there (like me), naturally. Spicy Italian sausage, tomatoes, garlic, cream, lots of parmesan cheese, and a touch of fresh basil make this recipe a winner.
        
        Penne goes really well with this spicy Italian sausage pasta recipe. The little tubes are perfect for that sauce. You can use any shape you want, though.
        <strong>Pro tip: </strong>Want to make this pasta more spicy? Add a pinch of cayenne pepper or some red pepper flakes. On the flip side, if you don't want it to be spicy, just use mild Italian sausages. ðŸ™‚</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>8 ounces uncooked penne</li>
            <li>10.6 ounces hot Italian sausages crumbled (see note)
            <li>3 cloves garlic minced</li>
            <li>1/2 cup chicken broth or white wine</li>
            <li>1/2 tablespoon flour</li>
            <li>(14 fluid ounce) can diced tomatoes with juices</li>
            <li>1/2 cup heavy/whipping cream</li>
            <li>Salt & pepper to taste</li>
            <li>6 large leaves basil sliced/torn into small pieces</li>
            <li>freshly grated parmesan cheese to taste</li>
            </u>

        <h4>Steps</h4>
        <ol>
            <li>Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook pasta al dente according to package directions.</li>
            <li>Take the sausage meat out of the casings and crumble it into a deep skillet. Cook it for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, over medium-high heat until browned.</li>
            <li>Once the sausage is browned, take it out of the pan and set it aside. Drain the fat.</li>
            <li>Add the garlic, followed by the chicken broth to the skillet. Sprinkle the flour in. Whisk it until the flour has dissolved, and scrape any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Cook this mixture until it's significantly reduced (should only take a minute or two in total).</li>
            <li>Add in the tomatoes, cream, and the sausage meat. Cook the sauce for a few more minutes until it's thickened to your liking. Season with salt & pepper as needed.</li>
            <li>Just prior to serving, add in the torn basil leaves and then toss with the drained pasta. Serve with freshly grated parmesan cheese.</li>
        </ol>
